      "text":"We believe that new students at Mackenzie should be provided the opportunity to attend a virtual club crawl to learn about the clubs offered at the beginning of the year, even if in-person club meetings would not resume for a few months. Weâ€™d host Club Crawl on a platform called Gather.town, where students would be able to interact with others around them and various objects for presentations, websites, and the like. Compared to the format taken this year of strictly receiving information through a week of Zoom presentations, revamping Club Crawl to make it more personable and customizable is one of our initiatives. Gather.town features proximity chat, and allows students to speak directly with clubs and ask questions to the ones that pique their interest."

      "text":"There would be one general podium, and each club would do a short 1-2 minute long elevator pitch to promote their booth. During this, students can choose to listen in, or move around to individual club areas scattered throughout the world. Booths would provide more in-depth resources, and students could ask specific questions. As well, Gather.town allows for club executives to create their own presentation in addition to the one minute summary, and present it on their club booth to further elaborate club activities and any extra details."

      "text":"Additionally, there would be a general information Google Form where students could mark clubs that they are interested in. At the end of Club Crawl, all submissions would be compiled and distributed to the clubs they signed up for, and makes the onboarding process more efficient as students would not have to fill out very similar forms for every club they would like to join."
