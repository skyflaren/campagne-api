      "text":"Having felt the rift this year regarding clubs and hearing the ways in which the current system in place could be improved, we’d like to implement some modifications. To start off, we’d create a centralized Google Drive folder where documents such as the meeting agenda would be located. Next, we’d initiate the anonymous feedback form, where suggestions and concerns would be collected and reviewed. We’d try to schedule Club Presidents’ meetings favourably by offering a few times that would work for club supervisors and VPs, and then create a poll for all the Club Presidents to vote on. Starting a method of communication other than email would allow for more frequent and free discussion, and for us to provide more updates regarding new policies that are in the works to collect first-hand feedback. Depending on the needs for supervision, we’d like to propose using Slack, Discord, or a Facebook Group to allow for the streaming of different information, announcing the agenda ahead of time, as well as offer opportunities to append on the agenda."

      "text":"We’d also like to propose the ability for clubs to apply for extra funding during the school year. After budgets have been allocated at the start of the year, if a bit of extra money is needed by a club and there’s additional money or if SAC could spare some, it would be provided. For example, if a club would like to host an event and did not have enough money for a few prizes, they could apply for extra funding."
