At our old school, she was always willing to help out and be a role model for the younger students. I think Nicole would be a great VP at William Lyon Mackenzie because of her experience in Middle School Student Council and other leadership opportunities. She will actively listen to the student body, and ultimately make the school a better place. I've only known Justin for a few months, but he has become a great friend. He isn't in my grade, but still takes the time to develop a friendship with me, and help me with aspects of High School that I have not yet grasped. This year, Justin and I were part of the same MSEO team (Justin was Event Leader), and during the event designing process, he has shown nothing but leadership, kindness, and respect to his group members. I think Justin would be a great VP at William Lyon Mackenzie, because of his connections to people as well as his ability to create new connections people he's never met before.",

He spends so much time in his work, finding even the most minuscule details that no one else would ever consider looking for (video editing, assignments etc.). He's also very approachable, and I don't hesitate to ask him for help on something if I need it, whether it's advice for a comm tech assignment, or just some proofreading a club announcement. I'm sure that Justin will put all his hard work and effort into SAC as well, so he's definitely the best candidate for vice president!",

Despite all her ambitions and accomplishments, this does not deter Nicole from being a empathetic person always willing to help those to the best of her abilities. Nicole is tenacious, setbacks will never deter her from completing a goal she has already set her eyes on, adamant on seeing through her goals to the end. However, this does not mean Nicole is rash in her decisions as she rarely advances without intricate planning. The previously mentioned traits in what describes Nicole are traits of a great leader. In Sun Tzu's The Art of War, he describes a leader of being a mixture of five main traits: intelligence, credibility, humaneness, courage, and discipline. Nicole is able to embody each of these five traits. Nicole's calculating nature and her ample amount of academic achievement fulfills the intelligence trait. Her sheer dedication to her work and promises perfectly embodies the trait of credibility. Humaneness manifests itself in Nicole's empathy and willingness to unconditionally help those in need. Courage is realized in her risk-taking nature, as evident in her running for vice president in this SAC election. Finally discipline is almost perfectly personified in Nicole with her determination to complete everything with her best efforts. Of all the people in WLMAC, I cannot think of a single person more qualified than Nicole for this position.",

From the days sharing a stand with him in Concert Band 3 years ago, to seeing the work he has produced on SAC to his dedication to the Lyon, I have frequently been in awe of his ability to create and his dedication to what he puts his mind too. Justin is a person you can trust to get the job done - I think he is extremely well suited to be in a leadership role representing the student body.",

      "test": "I think Nicole Cui would be a good candidate for vice president because she has excellent leadership skills and is very responsible and hard-working. From my past experiences with her in our old student council, she did a great job planning each meeting, organizing everyone's responsibilities, creating resources for people to reference, and doing extra work by helping new council members learn the ropes. While I don't know Justin Lu as well, from what I've seen, he's also a good candidate for the job. He helps a lot with clubs in the school and has been kind and respectful to the younger grades. Justin and Nicole would be an amazing pair to have in the student council!",
